# Music Playlist

## Description
This project involves implementing a music playlist using a recursive singly linked list. The playlist is represented by a linked list where each node contains information about a song, including the song title, ID, and a pointer to the next node. Various functions are implemented to perform operations on the playlist, such as inserting a song, deleting a song, displaying the playlist, finding the minimum ID, determining the length, searching for a song by title or ID, and deleting the entire playlist.

## Functions

1. `insertSongAtEnd()`: Inserts a song at the end of the playlist using a recursive definition.
2. `insertSongAfter()`: Inserts a song after a specific song using an iterative definition.
3. `deleteSongFromEnd()`: Deletes a song from the end of the playlist using a recursive definition.
4. `displayPlaylist()`: Displays the playlist using a recursive definition.
5. `findMinID()`: Finds the minimum ID among the songs in the playlist using a recursive definition.
6. `playlistLength()`: Determines the length of the playlist using a recursive definition.
7. `searchByTitle()`: Searches for a song in the playlist by its title using a recursive definition.
8. `searchByID()`: Searches for a song in the playlist by its ID using a recursive definition.
9. `deletePlaylist()`: Deletes the entire playlist using a recursive definition.

## Usage
1. Compile and run the program.
2. The program will display a menu with various options.
3. Enter the corresponding number to avail of a specific functionality.
4. Follow the prompts to enter details of songs or search criteria.
5. The program will perform the desired operation and display the results.
6. Repeat the process or choose to stop when prompted.

Note: Make sure to follow the provided function definitions and use the appropriate prompts for user input.
